Maximum voltage before clipping on Audio Input, Aux L & Aux R = 3.3V peak-to-peak, AC. Input paths are AC coupled. 
Maximum voltage on GPIO pins = 3.3V DC. GPIO pins are not overvoltage protected, for voltages higher than 3.3V use an input protection circuit such as a diode clamp or a level shifter.
